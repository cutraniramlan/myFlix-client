##Objective
Using React, build the client-side for an app called myFlix based on its existing server-side code (REST API and database)

##Context
create the interface they’ll use when making requests to—and receiving responses from—the server-side. The
client-side of your myFlix app will include several interface views (built using the React library) that will
handle data through the (previously defined) REST API endpoints.
By the end of the Achievement, you’ll have a complete web app (client-side and server-side) built using
full-stack JavaScript technologies, which you can then showcase in your portfolio. This project will
demonstrate your mastery of full-stack JavaScript development. The complete tech stack you’ll
master is known as the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) stack.
